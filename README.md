[!NOTE] Discontinued
In lieu of WSL2 being not just usuable but often offering better integration, I will not be using Cygwin anymore for shell based Windows stuff. Still: enjoy :)

# devenv
Set up a shell based interface on windows, that is portable/local, easy to integrate/extend for libraries. Based on cygwin, fish, windows terminal, vscode. Currently focussed around C++ (but not necessary).
